# Deprecation Notice

Hi! Thanks for checking Minify out, unfortunately, due to OS-related Windowing Issues, I have moved development to a successor, Bittify.

[Check it out here!](https://github.com/Jyodann/Bittify)

Online services for Minify have currently been ceased, and the code here is meant for archival purposes. 

I hope you understand, and thank you for your continued support!

Minify is a Miniplayer built for Windows which shows the current song you have playing on [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/download/windows/). 

Useful for people who want to see what songs are currently playing without constantly tabbing back to the main application. It also be used as a Window Source on OBS for Twitch streamers to easily show what they are listening to.
